Explanation for calculateHasRun boolean:

Say we first start using the calculator and have not called calculate() yet, and we have an empty string for currentNumString. Then, say the very first button we push is (. If we had run calculate() since this current set of parenthesis was opened and we were opening another set of parenthesis INSIDE this one (nested parenthesis), then the new, nested set of parenthesis should have a \* put in front of it (if no other operator is explicitly specified).
However, since calculate() has not yet run for the current set of parenthesis, and we are opening a new set of parenthesis inside WITHOUT specifying an operator (remember, we just hit '(' followed by '(' ), then the equationStack now looks like this: ['+0', '+0'] and that second set of parenthesis should have a '+' in front of it (if no other operator has been explicitly specified) to avoid being multiplied by '+0' once the nested parenthesis close. so for example: ((2 + 2) (3 + 1)). The first ( is hit, and calculateHasRun is set to false on this line of code (it's already set to false at the top of the screen because calculate() has not run yet, and that's what sets it to true). Then, before we calculate anything, we open another set of (. Since calculateHasRun is still set to false, this second set of nested parenthesis gets a + put in front of it. Then we press 2 + and calculate() runs to update the equationStack[lastIndex] to go from '+0' to '+2'. The equationStack now looks like this: ['+0', '+2']. Then we press 2 again, and then close the parenthesis which causes calculate() to run a second time, this time solving for the 2 + 2 and updating the equationStack[lastIndex] to be '+4' before popping the stack and saving that '+4' to lastParenthesisSolution. Now the equationStack looks like this ['+0']. The lastParenthesisSolution is '+4'. But do we need to replace that operator? NO! We want it to be a + in this case, not a \*. This is because we want that '4' to be added to the '+0' at the beginning of the equationString that lives at equationStack[lastIndex] and not multiplied by it. We don't want 2 + 2 to turn into 0 because its sum of 4 was multiplied by the +0. Instead, we want 4 to be added to that +0, and then any SUBSEQUENT set of parenthenthetical math inside that level of parenthetical nesting should be multiplied by 4. So now the lastParenthesisSolution is '+4' and the equationStack is ['+0'] Closing the nested parenthesis doesn't change whether or not calculateHasRun, only opening a new set of parenthesis does that. So calculateHasRun is still set to true, because when we ran 2 + 2 and then closed the parenthesis, we certainly ran the calculate() function, which sets calculateHasRun to true. Now, since calculateHasRun is true, the next set of parenthesis that opens gets a \* put in front of it.
(unless there is a specified operator). Simpler example without nested parenthesis: (9 + 2) (4 + 2) should reduce to 11 \* 6. If the first set of parenthesis gets a \* put in front of it like the second set does, we'd end up with 0 \* 6, which would be wrong.
